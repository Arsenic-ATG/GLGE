A simple graphics library for 3D and 2D in C++\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Examples for G\+L\+GE}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
example code is in the files 2\+D\+Test.\+hpp, 2\+D\+Test.\+cpp as well as 3\+D\+Test.\+hpp and 3\+D.\+cpp. The test code is commented, especaly the 3D code, because it is very similar to the 2D code you need to write to create, draw and setup an Object. The differences are outlined in the comments.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Documentation for G\+L\+GE}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
the code is documented using doxygen, in the future an documentation should be in the files. But the documentation can allready be created like normal using doxygen.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Debugging}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
If you get an error, reading it can help you find the cause of it. The error outputs are defined in \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E/glge\+Errors.\+hpp\char`\"{}. If wanted, the errors can be checkted there, often there is a bit more information. Often causes for memory acces errors\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Not binding an camera before creating or updating 3D objects
\item inputing wrong values to an Object constructor with pointer arrays Often causes for G\+L\+\_\+\+I\+N\+V\+A\+L\+I\+D\+E\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+R\+A\+T\+I\+ON\+:
\item Drawing an empty object
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Use G\+L\+GE}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
Below is writen how to run G\+L\+GE on Linux. Technicaly, the library will run everywhere where the following librarys work\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open\+GL developer library
\item G\+L\+EW
\item Freeglut
\item all default C++ librarys
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
To install the lybrary, you need to download the source code. Then you can move the folder called \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E\char`\"{} wherever you want, just make shure to change the include path in \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E.\+h\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E.\+cpp\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E2\+D\+Core.\+h\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E2\+D\+Core.\+cpp\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E3\+D\+Core.\+h\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E3\+D\+Core.\+cpp\char`\"{}. Else, there would be compilation errors. The files \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E.\+h\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E.\+cpp\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E2\+D\+Core.\+h\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E2\+D\+Core.\+cpp\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E3\+D\+Core.\+h\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+G\+L\+G\+E3\+D\+Core.\+cpp\char`\"{} should be in the same directory as your main file, else there will be errors if you use the the Makefile included in the main folder.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Compiling}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
To compile a program that uses G\+L\+GE, the Makefile in the main folder can be used. This can output a few errors, and compiling it differently also works. Just make shure that the you include and compile with the needed librarys.
